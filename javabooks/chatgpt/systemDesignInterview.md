System design interviews are critical for roles in software engineering, especially those focused on architecture, scalability, and performance. These interviews assess a candidate's ability to design and implement complex systems. Here are some must-ask questions in a system design interview, categorized by different aspects of system design:

### Basics and Foundations
1. **How would you design a scalable system?** (e.g., a URL shortening service, a chat application, or a social media platform)
2. **Can you explain the trade-offs between a SQL and a NoSQL database?** When would you choose one over the other?
3. **How do you handle data consistency in distributed systems?**

### Performance and Scalability
4. **How would you design a system to handle high traffic?** (e.g., coping with spikes in load)
5. **Discuss how you would implement caching in a web application.** What data would you cache and why?
6. **Explain how a CDN (Content Delivery Network) works and when you would use one.**

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance
7. **How do you ensure data durability in your system design?**
8. **What strategies would you employ to make a system fault-tolerant?**
9. **How would you design a system to be self-healing in the face of failures?**

### Data Management
10. **How would you design a data model for a large-scale application?** (e.g., an e-commerce platform)
11. **Explain how you would handle data replication and synchronization across different geographical locations.**
12. **Discuss the importance of data partitioning and sharding in databases.**

### Security
13. **What security measures would you incorporate into your system design?**
14. **How do you secure data at rest and in transit?**
15. **Discuss strategies to prevent SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.**

### Architecture Patterns
16. **Can you explain the microservices architecture and its benefits and drawbacks?**
17. **How would you decide between using a monolithic architecture vs. a microservices architecture?**
18. **Explain the concept of API Gateway and its role in system design.**

### Networking and Communications
19. **How do you design a system for idempotency and eventual consistency in a microservices architecture?**
20. **Discuss the role of load balancers in a distributed system.** How would you implement session persistence in a load-balanced environment?
21. **Explain different messaging systems and queues.** When would you use synchronous vs. asynchronous communication?

### Advanced and Miscellaneous
22. **How would you design a system for global scalability?** (e.g., a global e-commerce platform)
23. **Discuss strategies for multi-tenancy in a SaaS application.**
24. **How would you approach legacy system migration or integration in your design?**

### Design Process and Decision Making
25. **Can you walk me through your thought process for designing [specific system]?** This open-ended question is designed to understand the candidate's approach to problem-solving and decision-making.

These questions cover a wide range of topics within system design and aim to assess a candidate's breadth and depth of knowledge. Remember, the goal of system design interviews is not necessarily to get the "right" answer but to demonstrate your thought process, your ability to ask the right questions, and how you handle trade-offs in complex systems.
